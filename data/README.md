# Data

Primary data files are `MayCruiseData.csv` and `OctCruiseData.csv`. These contain sampling data along with processed salinity, DIC, TA, and DO data.

Scallop sampling and processing data are included in `MayScallopData.csv` and `OctScallopData.csv`.

`GB_ResTimes.csv` contains residence time data extracted from Manning et al. 2009.

Data folders:
* `CTD` contains all CTD- and salinity-affiliated files. `CSV_raw`, `RSK_raw`, and `XLSX_raw` folders contain raw CTD data files of each respective filetype. `EM_profiles` folder contains raw profile data for each endmember site. `*_CTD.csv` files contain processed CTD data exported from MATLAB for each month. `*_salinity_bottles.csv` files contain raw salinity bottle data measured by Dave Wellwood. `*_sal_corrected.csv` files contain final processed salinity data corrected for CTD offset using bottle data. `*_MLD.csv` files contain mixed-layer depth calculations for all sites in each month.
* `DIC` contains raw DIC data files (`raw` folder).
* `TA` contains raw TA data files (`raw` folder) and files generated by the TA processing script (`processing_files` folder).
* `QC-bottle-data` contains historical data used for quality control.

External data folders:
* `MetOp-winds` contains gridded sea surface wind data from the MetOp satellite series.
* `OOI-pCO2` contains atmospheric pCO2 data used for the calculation of air-sea CO2 flux.
* `SAM-zones` contains spatial files for the sea scallop seasonal area management zones.
